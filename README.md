# GMOEA

The official implementation of GMOEA [1] with Pytorch:

    GMOEA.py is the main file.
    
    GAN_model.py is the GAN model used in GMOEA.(Add cpu version)
    
    IMMOEA_pro.py: IMF test problems
    
    global_parameter.py is the class including the general parameters for running GMOEA.
    
    mating_selection.py is the mating selection strategy used in GMOEA. Specifically, the mating selection strategy in RSEA [2] is used.
    
    spea2_env.py is the environmental selection strategy used in GMOEA. Specifically, the environmental selection strategy in SPEA2 [3] is used.
    
    NDSort.py is the non-dominated sorting method using the efficient non-dominated sorting method in [4].
    
    EAreal.py is the simulated binary crossover and polynomial mutation.
    
    PM_mutation.py is the polynomial mutation [5].
    
    tournament.py is the K-tournament selection [6].
